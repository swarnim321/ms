	Extracted intrinsic features from the training dataset of Diabetes-1 patients such as moving average, Fourier coeﬃcients, real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) among others.
	Trained the model with the help of a Naive-Bayes classifier predicting with an accuracy of 78%.
	The machine learning model developed aids the prediction of insulin levels for patients after meal, thus supporting the appropriate amount of insulin injection in the body.
